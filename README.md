### What I learned

1) use filter function to change the image viewing.

.img{
  float: right;
  height: 595px;
  filter: invert(0%) sepia(26%) saturate(915%) hue-rotate(222deg) brightness(97%) contrast(86%);
}

2) font families, adjust thickness of the text and font size, positioning etc.,  

h1{
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 700;
  font-size: 50px;
  position: relative;
  width: 600px;
}
